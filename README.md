## Hi, I’m Sengo 👋

I’m a **BCA student (2023–2026)** interested in **AI, machine learning, and full-stack development**.  
I like working close to fundamentals — understanding *why* systems behave the way they do, not just making them work.

I’m still early in the process and actively learning by building.

---

## What I’m focused on

- Building **small, complete AI-powered applications**
- Learning **model deployment and evaluation**
- Improving **software structure and clarity**
- Contributing to open source when possible

I care more about *understanding* than speed.

---

## Selected Skills

**Languages**
- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- C, C++, Java (academic use)

**AI / ML**
- scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Basic deep learning concepts
- Experimentation & evaluation

**Web**
- React, Tailwind CSS
- Node.js, Express
- REST APIs

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Docker (learning)
- Linux, VS Code

## Projects

### AI Algorithm Recommender
A small application that suggests suitable ML algorithms based on problem descriptions.

- Focused on **clarity and explainability**
- Uses classical ML models with evaluation
- Built mainly as a learning project

**Tech:** Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn  
**Repo:** https://github.com/sengobasar/Algorithm-name-recommender

---

### Portfolio Website
A simple personal website to document projects and learning.

**Tech:** React, Tailwind CSS  
**Live:** https://sengo-portfolio.netlify.app/

---

## How I think about learning

- I prefer **depth over breadth**
- I don’t rush titles — I let work speak first
- I’m comfortable saying *“I don’t know yet”*
- I try to build things end-to-end, even if small
